# An app that finds and displalys (to the console) the min and max number from an array:

## Intro:

This app will sort the smallest value to the lagest value. Then pick out the first value and then pick out the last value and display them to the console.



## How To Run This App

1. You will need Node to install live server. Do a global install of the live server package. This will allow you to use live server from any command line.

```
npm install -g live-server
```

2. Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone [ past link from repro into here ] 
```

Navigate to the 'start' folder:

```
$ ls [ this will show directory of your folders and files ] 
```

```
$ cd [ type in the name of the folder or file you wish to naviage into i.e. the 'start' folder ]
```

Run live server:

```
$ live-server
```

Once the App has started, you are presented with the application. To display the prime numbers in the console, click the 'Calculate' button. The list of the prime numbers will be displayed in the console. To bring up the console, right-click on UI and select 'inspect', then click the console tab.

### My Method:

I was going to use a for loop as my solution but in terms of speed using the built-in JavaScript function Math.min and Math.max is more efficent or faster.
