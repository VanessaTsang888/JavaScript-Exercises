# Function Returning Function App:

## Intro:

This app will display in to the console the 3 functions and each will returns a string.
The 3 unit tests has verified at least 3 different use cases.
The redundant function returns the inside function i.e. f1, then that returns a string i.e. apple.


## How To Run This App


1. Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone [ past link from repro into here ] 
```

Navigate to the 'start' folder:

```
$ ls [ this will show directory of your folders and files ] 
```

```
$ cd [ type in the name of the folder or file you wish to naviage into i.e. the 'start' folder ]
```

2. Open the redundantFunction.html file in a broswer, and in the terminal use this command:

```
node redundantFunction.js
```

Now the string for each of the the three functions (that is returned from the redunant fn) will get displayed in the console.

### My Method:

I used the Arrow Function as I feel that is the easiest way to solve the problem.
